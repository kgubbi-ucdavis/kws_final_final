# CNN Accelerator Project

## Overview

This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) accelerator on an ASIC. The design includes modules for managing weights and inputs, performing multiply-accumulate (MAC) operations, summing results with an adder tree, normalizing data, applying ReLU activation, and performing pooling operations. The project is integrated into a top-level wrapper (`user_project_wrapper`) that interfaces with external pins and a Wishbone bus.

#### Steps to Use Generative AI Effectively

To maximize the benefits of Generative AI in hardware design and development, consider the following steps:

1. **Clear and Specific Prompts**
    - Provide detailed and specific prompts when asking for code generation or debugging help. Clear instructions help the AI understand the requirements better and deliver more accurate results.

2. **Iterative Development**
    - Use an iterative approach to development. Start with simple designs and gradually add complexity, using Generative AI to verify each step and suggest improvements.

3. **Code Review and Validation**
    - Always review and validate the code generated by AI. While AI can significantly speed up development, human oversight ensures that the design meets all requirements and standards.

4. **Combining AI with Traditional Methods**
    - Use Generative AI alongside traditional design and verification methods. AI can handle repetitive and straightforward tasks, freeing up human developers to focus on complex and critical aspects of the project.

5. **Continuous Learning and Adaptation**
    - Stay updated with the latest advancements in Generative AI and adapt your workflows to incorporate new features and capabilities. This ensures that you are leveraging the full potential of AI in your projects.

#### Example Workflow

1. **Initial Design**: Describe the required module and functionality to the AI and request a basic Verilog implementation.
2. **Verification Setup**: Ask the AI to generate a testbench for the module and guide you through running simulations.
3. **Iterative Refinement**: Based on simulation results, request modifications and enhancements to the design from the AI.
4. **Debugging**: When errors are encountered, provide the error messages to the AI and request assistance in diagnosing and fixing the issues.
5. **Final Integration**: Once all modules are verified, ask the AI to help integrate them into the top-level design and generate the final project wrapper.

By following these steps, you can effectively harness the power of Generative AI to streamline the design, verification, development, and debugging processes in hardware projects like the CNN Accelerator.
